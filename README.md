# Deep-Learning-Models
*  Perceptron :   A Perceptron is a neural network unit that does certain computations to detect features or business intelligence in the input data.
*  Deep Feed Forward Neural Network :    Feedforward neural networks are also known as Multi-layered Network of Neurons (MLN). These networks of models are called feedforward because the information only travels forward in the neural network, through the input nodes then through the hidden layers (single or many layers) and finally through the output nodes.
*  Convolutional Neural Network :  A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.
*  Artificial Neural Network :  Artificial neural network (ANN) is a computational model that consists of several processing elements that receive inputs and deliver outputs based on their predefined activation functions
